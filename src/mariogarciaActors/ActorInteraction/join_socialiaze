5. Make Actors socialize

So far we have been sending messages to an actor, receiving messages as an actor, and even replying as an actor but
there’s one important part missing here… I want actors to talk to each other. Lets see how to do it.

5.1. Joining actors

When you want callers to wait an actor to terminate you should be using actor’s join() method. Sometimes maybe a client
calling to an actor, sometimes could be an actor sending messages to another actor.

    Actors provide a join() method to allow callers to wait for the actor to terminate. A variant accepting a timeout is
    also available
